<h1>9 Analogue video</h1>
This section goes a bit deeper into the world of analogue video. This
is meant
for people who want to have a more detailed description of analogue
video as given in section <font color="#ff0000">3</font>
(the introduction).
<h2>9.1 Analogue video signals</h2>
<p>
A <b> <i> video signal</i></b> is an electrical voltage that
fluctuates over time.
These fluctuations are interpreted by a TV set while an electron beam
is zigzagging across the screen to draw a picture, line by line. This
is also known as scanning, and a single line as a <b><i>scan line</i></b>.
The shape
of the signal fluctuations tell the TV how bright a certain spot on the
screen should be&nbsp; (<b><i>luma or Y</i></b>) and what color it
should have
(<b><i>chroma or C</i></b>).<br>
When a pulse of a certain shape in the signal occurs, the TV
knows a line has ended and that the beam should travel back to
the other edge of the screen to start drawing a new one. This is called
<b><i>horizontal
retrace</i></b>; the pulse is
known as <b><i>horizontal sync</i></b>.
While it is traveling back the beam is
switched off so you don’t see the trace. During the part of the video
signal
at which this is happening is called <b><i>horizontal blanking</i></b>
or <b><i>horizontal
delay</i></b>. For
each video line coming into a TV, only about 5/6th is actually being
drawn and
about the first 1/6th of
the total time is spent traveling back to the starting position. During
the horizontal blanking, another synchronizing signal is included
called <b><i>color
burst</i></b>.
It contains information needed to decode the color in the part of the
line you do see. A video source like a VCR produces an endless string
of
video lines.</p>
<p>A specially patterned video line, <b> <i> vertical sync</i></b>,
indicates that a
picture
is finished. At this point the beam is located at the bottom of the
screen and has to travel up again to be able to begin drawing the next
picture. With the electronics of the first TV's this would take some
time. This time interval is known as the <b><i>vertical retrace</i></b>
time. During this time, analogue video line signals will
keep coming in at regular intervals
from the TV tuner or the VCR, but the beam is switched off, so these
lines are not drawn on the screen. In the digital age, all kinds of
extra information like teletext is digitally encoded in these
video lines. This
group of lines is known as the <b><i>vertical blanking interval</i></b>
area (or <i>VBI</i>abbreviated)
and the encoded data as <b><i>VBI data</i></b>. The lines that result
in the picture
lines are called <b><i>active scan lines</i></b>.<br>

<p>Figure 3 shows the waveform of a NTSC scan line. In the
active part of the signal, a low signal results in the scan line being
black while a high signal results in it being white. A value in between
results in a grey line. The signal in the example would have resulted
in a horizontal white line being drawn. To have a small black dot in
the middle of this line, the signal would have to dip rapidly to black
level and up again. The faster the dip, the smaller the dot would
be.&nbsp; This brings us to another point: to show fine detail, the
signal needs to be able to change rapid. Rapid changes in a signal
equal high frequencies, since frequency is another word for changes per
time unit.
</p>
<p>This did give some problems when color was added later. There have been
various solutions for it, but the basic principle was the same: a
single high frequency was singled out and the color information was
superimposed (modulated) on it. This frequency was chosen so high that
if the signal was watched on a black and white TV, the color
information would only distort very fine details which most people
would not notice. This single frequency is called the Chrominance
subcarrier frequency. NTSC chose 3.58 MHz and PAL 4.43 MHz.<br>
In a color TV, this single frequency is filtered out and processed
separately by a process called Y/C separation. To decode the color
information, a reference signal is included in the horizontal blanking
part of the scan line. This reference signal is called the color burst
and can be seen in figure 4.&nbsp;

<p> The hue of the color is determined by the
phase difference between the color burst and the color subcarrier. The
amplitude determines the saturation. For a more elaborate explanation
we refer to the links in the reference section.
</p>
<p>Depending on the quality of the filter doing this separation, fine
luma detail around this frequency would be damaged to some extend,
while some luma fine detail would end up in the chroma signal and
course color artifacts. High Y frequencies (= fine detail) are mixed
with
low chroma frequencies (color
crosstalk = rainbow effects) and vice versa (luma crosstalk = dot
crawls). Look in the <a href="http://www.doom9.org/capture/chroma_artefacts.html">Removal of chroma artefacts</a> and the references therein for a more thorough explanation
and examples of these
artifacts and how to get rid of them.

<h2>9.2 The 625/50 (PAL) and 525/60 (NTSC) timings</h2>
<p>Depending on the frequency of the electricity mains in a country,
two
scan line timings have been developed: 625 lines/frame, 50 fields per
second and 525 lines/frame, 60 fields per second. These are often
(incorrectly) referred to as PAL and NTSC timing respectively,
referring to the TV systems adopted by Germany and America. (Actually
PAL and NTSC refer to the system used for color encoding, and nations
with PAL 525/60 and NTSC 625/50 systems DO exist. But in this guide we
will follow this incorrect habit too.)</p>
<p><b>PAL numbers:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>It takes 1 second to draw 25 frames.</li>
  <li>One frame contains 625 lines.</li>
  <li>One line takes 1 second / (25 x 625) = 0.000064 seconds or 64
µs (= microseconds) to draw.</li>
  <li>One field contains 288 active lines. The first line of field 1
and the last line of field 2 may contain a whole picture line,&nbsp;
only half a picture line or even be completely black. For capping
purposes and aspect ratio calculations, the PAL frame is assumed to be
576 lines high. If it turns out it wasn’t, you just end up with some
black lines at the top and the bottom of the picture.</li>
  <li>While a single scan line takes 64 µs to process, only 52
µs is actually spent drawing a picture line. This is the
‘official’ ITU-R BT.470-6 number. (Many analogue sources will not
completely adhere to this, mostly resulting in capping some extra black
pixels at the sides.)</li>
  <li>The Chrominance subcarrier frequency is 4,433.618.75 MHz<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>NTSC numbers:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>It takes 1 second to draw 29.97 frames.</li>
  <li>One frame contains 525 lines.</li>
  <li>One line takes 1 second / (29.97 x 525) = 0.000063556 seconds or
63.556 µs to draw.</li>
  <li>One field contains 243 active lines. The first line of field 1
and the last line of field 2 may contain a whole picture line, only
half a picture line or even be completely black. Most often,&nbsp;
these two lines will contain only half picture information.&nbsp; For
some reasons this has caused a lot of confusion about the active area
of
the NTSC frame, while this did not happen for PAL. The NTSC frame
consists of 486 lines. It contains at most 2x242.5 = 485 lines of
picture info. However, often only 484 lines are complete. Virtually all
capture
devices capture only 480 lines. Presumably that is because by capping
480,
you can avoid both the first line of field 1 and the last line of field
2. </li>
  <li>For capping purposes always use 480 lines. For some aspect ratio
calculations&nbsp; use 486 lines, and regard 480 as cropped from that.
Forget the about the other numbers. </li>
  <li>While a single scan line takes 63.556 µs to process by a
TV,
only 52.6555 µs is actually spent drawing a picture line. This is
the ‘official’ ITU-R BT.470-6 number, which is often used by people
dealing with digital video. There are many standards for NTSC/M, all
giving a slightly different number for the active part of a scan line. </li>
  <li>Assume 52.6555 µs if you need a number for calculations.
If&nbsp; the
analogue source used a different number, again this will result in
capping some extra black pixels at the sides or cropping a bit off.</li>
  <li>The Chrominance subcarrier frequency is 3,579.545 MHz<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>SECAM:</b></p>
SECAM is the French TV system. It follows the same timing as PAL above,
but encodes the color differently. Once the Video decoder is set to the
SECAM&nbsp; video standard, you can follow the PAL&nbsp; guides
<p><b>PAL/M:</b></p>
This is a TV system used in amongst others Brazil. It uses NTSC timing,
but PAL/M
color encoding. Once the Video decoder is set to the PAL_M video
standard, you can follow the NTSC guides.
<p><b>PAL-60:</b></p>
<p>Modern European equipment can handle both 625/50 and 525/60 timings.
It
cannot handle NTSC color encoding. So if you use European 'NTSC
playback' capable equipment to play back an American NTSC tape or DVD,
they will produce a signal that
retains the NTSC timing, but has both the color encoding and the color
carrier frequency converted to PAL. Modern
European TV’s understand this hybrid signal and show the video. Some
game consoles also produce a PAL-60 signal instead of true PAL.<br>
To capture this, you need a device that understands PAL-60. Almost all
devices do. Unfortunately, many drivers won’t give you this option. If
your device/driver has the option, set the Video decoder to the PAL_60
video standard, and you can follow the NTSC guides for the rest.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="decoder.jpg" width="431" height="383"><br>
</p>
<p><b>NTSC 443:</b>
</p>
<p>NTSC 443 is another hybrid. It uses NTSC timing end color encoding,
but the color carrier frequency has been shifted from 3.58 to 4.43 MHz,
the PAL color carrier frequency. Some game consoles can output this.
Once you have set the decoder to the correct video standard, you can
follow the NTSC guides.
</p>
<h2>9.3 Signal types and sources
</h2>
<p>There are several signal types which are of interest for capturing:
RF, Composite, S-video and Component. In this
subsection the pros and cons will be discussed, in order decide which
type you
should use. Some characteristics:</p>
<b>
Composite/CVBS</b><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="CompositeJack.jpeg" align="middle"><br>
<br>
Composite video carries only video information; you will need
a separate lead for audio. All video information is present in a single
signal. Almost any video device can produce this signal. Capture
devices typically start by digitizing this signal and separating chroma
and luma digitally afterwards internally. This process is called <b><i>Y/C
separation</i></b>.
A way of doing this most capture devices use is called <i>Comb filtering</i>.
Unfortunately, this isn't quite
efficient, because the two signals luma (Y) and chroma (IQ for NTSC and
UV for PAL) overlap for (at
least) 1 MHz. Thus high Y frequencies (= fine detail) are mixed with
low chroma frequencies (color
crosstalk = rainbow effects) and vice versa (luma crosstalk = dot
crawls). Look in the <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.doom9.org/capture/chroma_artefacts.html">Removal
of chroma artefacts section</a></font> and the references therein for a more thorough explanation
and examples of these
artifacts.
<p><b>S-video or Y/C<br>
<br>
</b>
<img alt="" src="YCJack.jpg" align="middle" hspace="0"><br>
S-video or Y/C carries the luma and chroma components as separate
signals. Since no
Y/C separation is needed, there will be no comb-artifacts. If it is
possible to use
such a
S-video connection for capturing you should try it, because it will
probably
result in better quality.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this rule: devices that store video in
composite form, like laser disks but do have an s-video output have to
perform Y/C separation internally to produce this signal. If the
internal comb filter is of lesser quality than the comb filter in your
capture device, you would be better off using the composite video
signal instead. So always test!</p>
<p>A special case are VHS VCR tapes. Some people think VHS stores a
composite signal while S-VHS stores Y and C separately on tape. This
has
led to people mistakenly referring to s-video outputs as S-VHS outputs.
In fact, both formats store chroma at a lower frequency band than luma
(color under). For normal VHS, there is a very slight overlap between
the chroma and luma bands on tape, which was eliminated for S-VHS.
Still, on playback both formats produce separate Y and C signals. To
produce a composite signal, a standard VHS VCR will join these again.
Your capture device will have to separate them again, producing the
above mentioned artifacts.</p>
<p>A S-VHS recorder however will keep Y and C separate, even when playing
back normal VHS tapes. So if you can get your hands on one, use a S-VHS
recorder even when you only want to digitize ordinary VHS tapes.</p>
<p>A final argument for preferring s-video for grabbing lies in the way
capture devices operate. Most devices have two
Analogue-to-Digital-Converters (ADC). When capping analogue, only one
of those is used. When capping Y/C however, each signal gets it's own
ADC which increases the sample resolution and precision. There simply
will be more data for the device to work with.</p>
<p><b>Component variations: RGB (Europe) and Component Video YPbPr (US)</b></p>
<table border="0" width="100%" height="239">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td width="50%" align="center" height="206"><img alt="" src="scart.gif" width="250" height="162"></td>

    <td width="50%" align="center" height="21"> Component Video YPbPr (US)</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
Component video splits up the video information in three signals. In
America, Component Video or YPbPr is prevalent. It is made up of the
luma component (Y), the red
difference sample (= R-Y = U) and blue difference sample (= B-Y = V).
Again, there is no Y/C separation and hence no comb-artifacts.&nbsp;
In Europe, RGB was chosen instead. It carries Red, Green and Blue as
separate signals. (Sometimes&nbsp; it uses 4 signals, R,G,B and sync.)
In Europe, the most common form for a RGB connector is the SCART
connector, though RCA and BNC connectors are also found on some
equipment. Since consumer equipment rarely can capture these signals
and most
analogue sources cannot output them anyway, the component signal
types are not of interest to us.</p>
<p>A few words about the <b> SCART connector</b>: this connector is just that, a
connector. Depending on the device it can contain composite, s-video,
RGB, sound and various control signals, both in and out and in any
combination.&nbsp; Having a SCART does not imply having RGB or s-video.
For instance, most European standard VHS VCR's have a SCART connector
that only delivers composite and sound. Using the SCART adapter below
will not give you s-video in that case; the result would be that the
composite signal ends up on the Y pin of the s-video lead, resulting in
a flickering black and white picture.<br>
<br>
  <img alt="SCART adapter" src="scart.gif" width="131" height="85"><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>RF (Broadcast)</b><br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="RFConnector.jpg"></p>
<p>
RF is the signal used for TV broadcast. A composite video signal and
a mono or stereo audio signal are modulated onto a radio carrier wave.
To decode this you need a TV card. The TV card will split of
the carrier wave and decode the audio signal. Typically, he resulting
audio signal is fed into the line in of the sound card using an
internal
or external
loop-through cable. The resulting video signal is composite and suffers
from the same limitations.</p>
